# Using the ContextOS runtime

## 1. Embed the kernel in your agent (no server)

The kernel is pure and deterministic, so it can run inside the agent process on the hot
path. Every binding exposes the same operations (see `crates/contextos-embed`).

Python (`bindings/python`, built with maturin):

```python
import contextos
compiled = contextos.compile(pack, request, run_context, {"evidence": evidence})
for gate in compiled["runtime_controls"]["evidence_gates"]:
    if not gate["commit_allowed"]:
        ...  # do not commit this decision; gather the unresolved evidence
decision = contextos.evaluate_authorization(authorization_input)
```

Node (`bindings/node`, N-API; async calls run on the libuv pool):

```js
import { kernel } from "@contextos/kernel";
const compiled = await kernel.call("compile", { pack, request, run_context });
```

Any WebAssembly host (`bindings/wasm`; the module imports nothing):

```js
const ctx = await load(await fs.readFile("contextos_wasm.wasm"));
const { action_digest } = ctx.call("digest_action_binding", binding);
```

Embedding gives you deterministic decisions. Durable effect safety — single dispatch,
reconciliation, conserved budgets, the audit chain — needs the stores, which the
gateway (in-process in Rust, or `contextosd`) provides.

## 2. Run `contextosd`

```sh
ctx hash-key            # paste a ≥32-character key; configure only the hash
contextosd --config deploy/contextosd.example.toml
```

Callers authenticate with a bearer token: an API key (configured only as its hash),
or a JWT from an OIDC issuer you configure:

```toml
[[oidc]]
issuer = "https://login.example.com/"        # exact iss
audience = "contextosd"                      # required aud
jwks_url = "https://login.example.com/.well-known/jwks.json"
tenants = ["tenant_acme_prod"]               # tenants this issuer may assert
tenant_claim = "tenant_id"                   # default
scope_claim = "scope"                        # default; string or array
algorithms = ["RS256", "ES256"]              # default; HS* and none are refused
```

Keys are fetched in the background (every `refresh_seconds`, and soon after an unknown
`kid`, at most once per 30 s); `/readyz` reports not ready until every issuer's keys
have loaded. Tokens need `kid`, `iss`, `aud`, `sub` and `exp`. Scopes recognized:
`compile`, `admit`, `dispatch`, `audit:read`.

| Route | Scope | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /v1/compile` | `compile` | Compile a pinned pack |
| `POST /v1/runs` | `admit` | Admit a run: compile, negotiate, pin policy, open ledgers |
| `POST /v1/runs/{run_id}/tool-calls` | `dispatch` | Govern and dispatch one tool call |
| `POST /v1/contracts/negotiate` | `admit` | Check a contract against this deployment |
| `POST /v1/schemas/{schema}/validate` | any | Validate a payload against a published schema |
| `GET /v1/audit/verify` | `audit:read` | Verify the tenant's signed audit chain |
| `GET /metrics`, `/healthz`, `/readyz` | – | Operations |

Tool-call results use `contextos.tool_result.v1`:

| `status` | Meaning | Caller action |
|---|---|---|
| `ok` / `completed` | effect confirmed (read-only / effectful) | continue |
| `paused` | approval pending, or effect outcome unknown | wait for approval or reconcile; never blind-retry |
| `blocked` | authority, policy, constraint or budget refused | do not retry unchanged |
| `rejected` | malformed, unpinned, unsurfaced or incompatible reuse | fix the call |
| `failed` | provider definitively did not apply the effect | may retry per the capability's recovery policy |

## 3. Integrate your services

Dispatch needs three fact services you operate (see `crates/contextos-adapters/src/remote.rs`
for the request/response contracts and `examples/support-refund/dev_services.py` for a
minimal, development-only implementation):

- **Authority broker** — verifies the agent's mandate and returns grants plus verified,
  current, unrevoked observations for the exact binding.
- **Control plane** — attests that each required independent control (isolation, egress
  mediation, data-flow policy…) is active for this action digest and pinned policy.
- **Approval service** — opens requests bound to the action digest and returns verified
  decisions and approver entitlements.

Capabilities are admitted only from reviewed manifests (`ctx manifest <file>`); protocol
discovery is never permission. Adapters: MCP `2026-07-28` (stateless Streamable HTTP) or
HTTP/JSON, HTTPS only, no redirects, credentials from your broker.

## 4. Operate

- **Store:** PostgreSQL. Grant the runtime role `SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE` on
  `contextos_documents` and `SELECT, INSERT` only on `contextos_audit_log` (updates and
  deletes are also blocked by trigger).
- **Keys:** the audit signing seed comes from your KMS/HSM via environment. Rotate by
  adding the new public key to verifiers before switching writers.
- **Declare only what you enforce:** `[support].controls` is a claim that your providers
  enforce those controls. Runs that need more are refused at admission.
- **Metrics:** `contextos_http_requests_total`, `contextos_http_request_duration_ms`,
  `contextos_dispatch_outcomes_total{status}`. Logs are JSON with a `contextos.dispatch`
  span per tool call (run, operation, capability, digest, status, reasons).
- **Image:** `Dockerfile` builds a distroless, non-root image.
